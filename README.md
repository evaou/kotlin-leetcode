### Linked List
A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node called **head**.
Each node contains a **data** and a pointer to the **next** node. 
The last node is **null**.
- Dynamic size
- Easy to insert or delete node
- No random access
- Extra memory for pointer
- LeetCode

### Hash Table
**Hash table** uses an array to store data with the unique generated index.
**Hash function** converts a key to an array index, 
which easily computes and uniformly distributes the keys.
- Fast insertion or search
- LeetCode
